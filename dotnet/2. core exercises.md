### Core Exercise - Building Rock Paper Scissors in .NET

1. Clone the starter repository which contains the basic solution structure:
   - RockPaperScissors.Core (game logic)
   - RockPaperScissors.Api (REST API)
   - RockPaperScissors.Tests (unit tests)
   - RockPaperScissors.Console (console interface)

2. Test the initial program state:
   ```bash
   cd RockPaperScissors.Console
   dotnet run
   ```
   You should see a welcome message, and the program will throw a NotImplementedException since the game logic hasn't been implemented yet. This is expected!

3. Open the `Game.cs` file in RockPaperScissors.Core project
4. Implement the `Play` method in the `Game` class:
   - Use GitHub Copilot to help implement the basic Rock Paper Scissors logic
   - The method should return Win, Lose, or Draw based on the player's move

5. Run the console application again to test your implementation:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
