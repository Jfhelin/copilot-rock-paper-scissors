### Core Exercise - Building Rock Paper Scissors in .NET

1. Clone the starter repository which contains the basic solution structure:
   - RockPaperScissors.Core (game logic)
   - RockPaperScissors.Api (REST API)
   - RockPaperScissors.Tests (unit tests)
   - RockPaperScissors.Console (console interface)

2. Test the initial program state:
   ```bash
   cd RockPaperScissors.Console
   dotnet run
   ```
   You should see a welcome message, and the program will throw a NotImplementedException since the game logic hasn't been implemented yet. This is expected!

3. Open the `Game.cs` file in RockPaperScissors.Core project
4. Implement the `EvaluateResult` method in the `Game` class:
   - Use GitHub Copilot to help implement the basic Rock Paper Scissors logic
   - The method should return Win, Lose, or Draw based on the player's move and the computer's move

5. Open the `Program.cs` file in RockPaperScissors.Console project
6. Implement the console game logic:
   - Prompt the user to enter their move
   - Parse the user's input and validate it
   - Generate a random move for the computer
   - Call the `EvaluateResult` method to determine the game result
   - Display the result to the user

7. Run the console application again to test your implementation:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
