<summary>Challenge #2 - Implementing Unit Tests</summary>

### Adding Unit Tests

1. Navigate to RockPaperScissors.Tests project
2. Implement tests for all possible game outcomes
3. Use GitHub Copilot to help generate test cases
4. Aim for 100% code coverage

Example test scenarios:
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Paper covers Rock
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock

### Running the Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the RockPaperScissors.Tests project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RockPaperScissors.Tests
   ```

2. Run the tests using the .NET CLI:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

3. Verify that all tests pass and review the test results in the terminal output.

<summary>Challenge #3 - Implementing the REST API</summary>

### Completing the API

1. Navigate to the RockPaperScissors.Api project
2. Open the `GameController.cs` file 
3. Implement the `Play` endpoint in `GameController`:
   - Accept a JSON request body with the player's move
   - Generate a random move for the computer
   - Call the `EvaluateResult` method to determine the game result
   - Return the result and the computer's move in the response

### Testing and Debugging the API

1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Set breakpoints in the `GameController.cs` file.
3. Open the Debug panel in VSCode.
4. Select the ".NET Core Launch (API)" configuration.
5. Start debugging by pressing F5.
6. Use the web browser to navigate to the `/game/play` endpoint with a query parameter for the player's move:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/game/play?move=Rock
   ```
7. Verify that the response contains the game result and the computer's move.
8. Trigger the breakpoints to debug the API.
